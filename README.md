# Udacity Bookmark Server

A simple link shortener created while working through Udacity's HTTP & Web Servers course (as part of the Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree). With no persistent storage, links are saved to a Python dictionary and will therefore disappear as soon as the server goes down.

## Instructions

1. Visit the deployed app [here](https://bookmark-svr.herokuapp.com/).

2. Enter the target URI into the 'Long URI' input box, enter the desired short name below in the 'Short name' input box, and then click on the 'Save it!' button.

3. After a valid submission, the newly added link will appear below.
